In this Blocksworld simulation, the goal is to rearrange a set of blocks on a virtual board to achieve a specific configuration. The system allows blocks to be moved from one location to another, either stacking them on top of each other or placing them directly on the board. Each action must consider whether a block is clear of others on top and whether the destination block or space is available. The gameplay mechanics are guided by precise predicates that ensure each block's position is valid and visually represented with distinctive properties for easy identification and interaction.
