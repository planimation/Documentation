Peg Solitaire is a classic single-player board game where the objective is to clear the board of pegs by jumping one peg over another into an empty hole, removing the jumped peg. The game typically begins with a single empty hole and ends when no more moves are possible, with the goal being to leave only one peg remaining on the board. The game challenges players to think strategically and plan their moves carefully to achieve this goal.
