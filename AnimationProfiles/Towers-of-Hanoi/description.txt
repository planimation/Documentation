In this Towers of Hanoi puzzle, the objective is to move a disc from one peg to another following specific rules. Each move involves transferring a disc from its current peg to a target peg, ensuring the disc is smaller than the target peg and both the disc and target peg are clear. The animation aligns the discs properly and visually represents the pegs and discs on a board. The goal is to move disc d1 from peg1 to peg3 while adhering to the constraints.
