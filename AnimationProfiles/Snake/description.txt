In this snake game simulation, the goal is to control the snake as it moves around a grid, aiming to consume points to grow longer while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. The system uses specific predicates to define the movement of the snake's head and tail, ensuring that each move is adjacent and valid. Actions such as moving and eating points dynamically adjust the snake's length and position on the grid, enhancing the gameplay by increasing the complexity and challenge as the snake grows.
