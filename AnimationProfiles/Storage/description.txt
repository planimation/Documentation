In this storage and logistics simulation, the aim is to manage the handling and distribution of crates within a depot using hoists. The system incorporates precise movements such as lifting, moving, and dropping crates, ensuring that each crate is strategically placed or retrieved from designated areas. The dynamic interaction between hoists and storage areas emphasizes efficient space utilization and operational logistics in a depot environment.
