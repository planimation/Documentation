In this soldier movement game, the player must move left and right soldiers across a series of connected ground segments. The left soldiers move from left to right, while the right soldiers move from right to left. Soldiers can either move to the next ground segment if it is clear or jump over an occupied segment to the next clear one. The goal is to have all left soldiers reach the far right ground segments and all right soldiers reach the far left ground segments, following the game's movement rules and constraints.
