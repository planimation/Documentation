In this game, a fisherman must transport a family (father, mother, son, and daughter) across a river using a boat. The boat can carry a maximum of two people at a time and must always have at least one person to row it. The son and daughter cannot be left alone with the father or mother without another child present. The goal is to get all family members to the opposite bank and then return the boat to the starting point with the fisherman.
